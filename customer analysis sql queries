 select gender, sum(purchase_amount) [ Revenue] FROM CUSTOMER
 GROUP BY GENDER

--  Q2. Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount? 

 SELECT customer_id, purchase_amount
FROM customer
WHERE discount_applied = 'Yes'
  AND purchase_amount >= (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM customer); -- The "Average" Trap: You cannot compare a single row's purchase_amount to the AVG(purchase_amount) of the whole table directly in a HAVING clause. You need a Subquery to calculate that average first.

-- Q3. Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
select TOP 5 item_purchased,AVG(REVIEW_RATING) [ AVG REVIEW rating] FROM CUSTOMER
GROUP BY ITEM_PURCHASED
ORDER BY AVG(REVIEW_RATING) DESC

SELECT SHIPPING_TYPE , AVG(purchase_amount) [ avg purchase amount] from customer
where shipping_type in ('standard', 'express')
group by shipping_type

--Q5. Do subscribed customers spend more? Compare average spend and total revenue 
--between subscribers and non-subscribers.

select avg(purchase_amount) [ average spend], sum(purchase_amount) [ total revenue] , subscription_status from customer 
where subscription_status in ('yes', 'No')
group by (subscription_status)

--Q6. Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
SELECT TOP 5
    item_purchased,
    AVG(CASE WHEN discount_applied = 'Yes' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 [discount_percentage]
FROM customer
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY discount_percentage DESC;

--Q7. Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their total 
-- number of previous purchases, and show the count of each segment.
 

WITH CustomerSegments AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN previous_purchases < 10 THEN 'New'
            WHEN previous_purchases BETWEEN 10 AND 30 THEN 'Returning'
            ELSE 'Loyal'
        END AS segment

SELECT age_group,

 AVG(PURCHASE_AMOUNT) [ Avg transaction value] from customer
group by age_group
order by  [ Avg transaction value] desc

--Quuestion 9: "The Frequency vs. Value Correlation"

--Question: Do customers who shop more often (lower days between visits) actually spend less per ticket?
select purchase_frequency_days , COUNT(customer_id) [total shoppers], AVG(PURCHASE_AMOUNT) [ Avg transaction value] from customer
group by purchase_frequency_days
order by   purchase_frequency_days ASC


--question 10 :What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?

    GROUP BY category, item_purchased
)

--Q11. Are customers who are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) also likely to subscribe?
select * from customer
--query is below:
select subscription_status, COUNT(customer_id) [Repeat Buyers] from customer
where previous_purchases > 5
group by subscription_status

--Q12. What is the revenue contribution of each age group?
select age_group , SUM(purchase_amount) [ Total revenue] from customer
